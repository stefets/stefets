My repositories defined here are intended to be used for performances of all kinds using the awesome [mididings API](https://github.com/mididings/mididings) as the *kernel* of my logic.

⚡ [flaskdings](https://github.com/stefets/flaskdings) is an UI and API I wrote to communicate with my mididings API.

⚡ [live-config](https://github.com/stefets/live-config) is my *mididings script builder API*, made for my needs but adaptable.

⚡ [osc-soundcraft-bridge](https://github.com/stefets/osc-soundcraft-bridge) 
* It is a bridge between the OSC protocol and the SoundCraft UI series. 
* A daemon that translate an OSC message to a socket message understood by the Soundcraft server.
* *It does not depend on mididings*.
