#### Hi, I maintain 4 repositories to make live music; two of them depends on dsacre/mididings that I have forked
âš¡ live-config which is my main application for live performance it generate my fatty script for mididings and start the engine.

âš¡ flaskdings which is an API and a HTML5 UI to communicate with mididings through the OSC protocol. It is a modern alternative to the livedings GUI included in the mididings solution.

âš¡ A fork of dsacre/mididings to be able to compile and run it with the very latest Python version, in a virtual environment.

âš¡ osc-soundcraft-bridge which is a bridge between the OSC protocol and the SoundCraft UI series; so I can send OSC message via MIDI with mididings and the bridge convert the OSC message to a UI message and send it to the mixer via socket.
