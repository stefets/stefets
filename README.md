### I am a mididings power user with a five years of learning curve and near, daily usage. I support users on the https://groups.google.com/g/mididings

#### I maintain 5 repositories to make live music; three of them depends on dsacre/mididings that I have forked

⚡ live-config which is my main application for live performance it generate my fatty script for mididings and start the engine.

⚡ flaskdings which is an API and a HTML5 UI to communicate with mididings through the OSC protocol. It is a modern alternative to the livedings GUI included in the mididings solution.

⚡ node-red-flow-mididings which is a Node Red Flow to communicate with mididings through the OSC protocol. It is a modern alternative to the livedings GUI included in the mididings solution and a alternative of my flaskdings application as well; my priority is flaskdings and this flow is an experimentation.

⚡ osc-soundcraft-bridge which is a bridge between the OSC protocol and the SoundCraft UI series; I send OSC message via MIDI with mididings and the bridge convert the OSC message to a UI message and send it to the mixer via socket.

⚡ A fork of dsacre/mididings to be able to compile and run it with the very latest Python version, in a virtual environment.
