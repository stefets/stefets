# I maintain three repositories to make live music
### Two of them depends on https://github.com/mididings/mididings a well maintained version of the abandonned github.com/dsacre/mididings

âš¡ live-config which is my main entry point for live performance, a bash script that generate my fatty script for mididings and start the engine.

âš¡ flaskdings which is an API and a HTML5 UI to communicate with mididings through the OSC protocol. It is a modern alternative to the livedings GUI included in the mididings solution.

âš¡ osc-soundcraft-bridge which is a bridge between the OSC protocol and the SoundCraft UI series; I send OSC message via MIDI with mididings and the bridge convert the OSC message to a UI message and send it to the mixer via socket.
