#### Hi, I maintain 3 repositories to make live music
âš¡ live-config which is my main application for live performance it generate my fatty script for mididings and start the engine.

âš¡ flaskdings which is an API and a HTML5 UI to communicate with mididings through the OSC protocol. It is a modern alternative to the livedings GUI included in the mididings solution.

âš¡ A fork of dsacre/mididings to be able to compile it and run on the very latest Python version virtual environment as well.
